--Targets--

all: Attempt to run gofmt and if it passes build any binaries or libraries. If the build completes
		 without errors a taball is created and dropped into the targetdir for a binary. This is
		 the default Yieldbot target for the golang build pipeline. Ex. `make all`

build: Run go build with a pre-defined set of options. By default a binary will be built
			 for linux/amd64, named the same as the package, and any output will be placed
			 in ./bin. Ex. `make build`

			 For more fine grained control over bulding check out `go compile` and go `link`.

clean: Remove any files that are used or produced during the building and packaging
			 steps. This will include the binaries and tarballs as well as the
			 directories that these would get dropped into. Ex. `make clean`

coverage: This needs to be implemented.

dist: Create a compressed tar archive of all binary produced during the build steps.
			The tarball will be placed into the directory defined by the <targetdir> make
			variable. Ex. `make dist`

format: Run the gofmt tool. This will produce a list of files that do not conform
				to the standards set via golang. If you want to attempt to fix these errors
				automatically see the <format_correct> task.

format_correct: Attempt to automatically correct any issues presented via the gofmt
								tool.

install:  Install any binaries and info files into the directories specified by the
				 <destdir> and <infodir>. Ex. `make install`

info:  Build any texinfo documents found. Ex. `make info`

help:  Display this help message. Ex. `make help`

lint:  Run the golang linting tool. Ex. `make lint`

maintainer_clean: This needs to be implemented.

pre-build: Ensure that the necessary directories are present. This does not need to be
					 called by the user.

pre-dist: Ensure that the necessary directories are present. This does not need to be
					called by the user.

test: This needs to be implemented.

test-all: Run all optional testing targets.

--Variables--

infodir Set the location for installing GNU info files.
				Default: /usr/local/share/info

pkg Set the package to build. Ex. `make pkg="bobogono" build`
				Default: current working directory

srcdir Set the directory that the sources are in. Mostly only useful when building libraries or when
			 the code does not live at the repo root.
			 Default: .

target Set the path that the tarball will be dropped into. DrTeeth will look in
			 ./target by default but golang will put it into ./pkg if left to itself.
			 Default: target

destdir Set where the local binary should be installed to for testing purposes.
				Default: /usr/local/bin
